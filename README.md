# ASMI-ASMI-Adaptive-Slot-Management-for-Efficient-RAW-Operation-in-IEEE-802.11ah

# Abstract
IEEE 802.11ah introduces the Restricted Access
 Window (RAW) mechanism to limit contention and decrease
 collisions, thereby optimizing channel utilization for networks
 with a high density of IoT devices. RAW segments the stations
 into groups and allocates specific time slots (RAW slots) to each
 group. However, even within a group, the number of contending
 stations per slot can remain high, making efficient channel
 utilization a challenging task. Existing methods largely rely on
 requisition-based slot allocation, which introduces delays and
 incurs significant control packet overhead. In this paper, we
 propose an overlapping node-based Adaptive Slot Management
 scheme for IEEE 802.11ah (ASMI), wherein delay-sensitive
 nodes are allowed to transmit in earlier slots through over
lapping node. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
 approach significantly improves throughput, reduces delay, and
 enhances the channel utilization compared to conventional
 baseline approach.
